# Moldflow automation

Can we automate Autodesk Moldflow with Python? It turns out, we can! 

## Tutorial
Autodesk Moldflow is a popular injection molding software. The Autodesk Moldflow Synergy GUI is able to record user macros for automation as Visual Basic Scripts (*.vbs). However, we may want to integrate this automation with a Python workflow. We could start subprocesses to call Moldflow with a *.vbs script, but it is a much more seamless experience to control Moldflow directly from Python. Luckily, that is possible and the Jupyter notebook `tutorial.ipynb` illustrates how it is done. 

## Examples 
The `examples` directory contains a couple of examples, how we can integrate Autodesk Moldflow in a Python workflow.
