    "# Autodesk Moldflow automation tutorial \n",
    "\n",
    "Autodesk Moldflow is a popular injection molding software. The Autodesk Moldflow Synergy GUI is able to record user macros for automation as Visual Basic Scripts (*.vbs). However, we may want to integrate this automation with a Python workflow. We could start subprocesses to call Moldflow with a *.vbs script, but it is a much more seamless experience to control Moldflow directly from Python. Luckily, that is possible and this Notebook illustrates how it is done. "
